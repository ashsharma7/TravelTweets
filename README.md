# TravelTweets

This is a very first iOS application I wrote in Xcode 7 using Swift 2.2. It maintains a list of official twitter handles of Airports and Airlines worldwide. You can view the content published by these handles officially.

I had published this app on the iOS app store for a while from May 2016 - December 2016, but took it down since its just a "Yet Another Twitter Client".

This app needs Twitter framework that I had installed via Fabric.
